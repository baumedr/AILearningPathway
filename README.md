# AI-Powered .NET Development Demo

Welcome to this comprehensive demonstration repository! This collection of scenarios is designed to showcase how AI coding assistants like KiloCode, Cursor, or Windsurf can accelerate and enhance .NET development workflows for developers at all skill levels.

## What are AI Coding Assistants?

AI coding assistants such as KiloCode, Cursor, and Windsurf are powerful development tools that help .NET developers write better code faster. They provide intelligent code generation, refactoring assistance, architecture guidance, and automated best practices implementation.

## Demo Scenarios Overview

This repository contains two comprehensive self-guided scenarios plus live demo options that demonstrate AI coding assistant capabilities across different complexity levels:

## Self-Guided Scenarios

## Live Demo Options

### üéØ [30-Minute Team Demo Sessions](./DEMO_OPTIONS.md)
**Interactive presentations designed for developer teams**

Choose from 5 different demo formats tailored to showcase AI coding assistant capabilities in engaging, hands-on sessions:
- **Quick Win Demo**: Rapid API development showcase
- **Legacy Rescue Demo**: Live modernization demonstration
- **Architecture Assistant Demo**: AI-powered system design
- **Code Quality Champion Demo**: Automated best practices implementation
- **Team Productivity Demo**: Collaborative development acceleration

Each demo includes detailed timelines, interactive elements, and follow-up suggestions to maximize team engagement and learning outcomes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting any scenario, ensure you have:

- **Visual Studio 2022** (17.8 or later) or **Visual Studio Code** with C# extension
- **.NET 8 SDK** (latest version)
- **Git** for version control
- **Docker Desktop** (optional, for containerization demos)
- **AI coding assistant** (KiloCode, Cursor, Windsurf, or similar) installed in your IDE

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AI-Coding-Assistant-Demo
   ```

2. **Choose your path**:
   - **Self-Guided Learning**: Start with [Scenario 1](./scenario-1-weather-api/) or [Scenario 2](./scenario-2-legacy-modernization/)
   - **Team Demo**: Review [Demo Options](./DEMO_OPTIONS.md) for live presentation formats

3. **Follow the detailed instructions** in each scenario's README.md or demo guide

## Learning Path Recommendation

For the best learning experience, we recommend:

```
Scenario 1 ‚Üí Scenario 2 ‚Üí Live Demo Experience
(Beginner)   (Intermediate)   (Team Application)
```

Start with self-guided scenarios to build foundational skills, then apply your knowledge in team demo sessions.

## What You'll Learn

By completing both scenarios and participating in demo sessions, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

- **AI-Assisted Development Workflows**: How to effectively collaborate with AI to write better code
- **Natural Language Programming**: Converting requirements into working code using conversational prompts
- **Intelligent Refactoring**: Leveraging AI for complex code transformations and modernization
- **Architecture Design**: Using AI to plan and implement scalable system architectures
- **Best Practices Automation**: How AI can automatically apply industry standards and patterns
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: AI-generated tests and code quality improvements
- **DevOps Integration**: AI-assisted CI/CD pipeline creation and deployment strategies

## Tips for Success

### Effective Prompting Strategies
- **Be specific**: Instead of "create an API," say "create a REST API for weather data with CRUD operations"
- **Provide context**: Mention your target framework, database, and any specific requirements
- **Iterate and refine**: Start with basic functionality and gradually add complexity
- **Ask for explanations**: Request that your AI assistant explain its decisions and recommendations

### Best Practices
- **Review generated code**: Always understand what the AI has created before proceeding
- **Test incrementally**: Run and test code after each major generation or modification
- **Version control**: Commit your progress regularly to track changes
- **Learn from suggestions**: Pay attention to the patterns and practices your AI assistant recommends

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **AI assistant not responding**: Ensure your internet connection is stable and the service is available
- **Generated code not compiling**: Check that all required NuGet packages are installed
- **Performance issues**: Large projects may require breaking down requests into smaller chunks

### Getting Help
- Check the troubleshooting section in each scenario's README
- Review the generated code comments for guidance
- Experiment with different prompt phrasings if results aren't as expected
